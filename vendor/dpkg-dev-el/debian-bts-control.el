    Records that bug #bugnumber is a bug in package. This can be used to
    set the package if the user forgot the pseudo-header, or to change an
    earlier assignment. No notifications are sent to anyone (other than the
    usual information in the processing transcript).

reopen bugnumber [ originator-address | = | ! ]

    Reopens #bugnumber if it is closed.

    By default, or if you specify =, the original submitter is still as the
    originator of the report, so that they will get the ack when it is
    closed again.

    If you supply an originator-address the originator will be set to the
    address you supply. If you wish to become the new originator of the
    reopened report you can use the ! shorthand or specify your own email
    address.

    It is usually a good idea to tell the person who is about to be
    recorded as the originator that you're reopening the report, so that
    they will know to expect the ack which they'll get when it is closed
    again.

    If the bug is not closed then reopen won't do anything, not even change
    the originator. To change the originator of an open bug report, use the
    submitter command; note that this will inform the original submitter of
    the change.

found bugnumber [ version ]

    Record that #bugnumber has been encountered in the given
    version of the package to which it is assigned.

    The bug tracking system uses this information, in conjunction
    with fixed versions recorded when closing bugs, to display
    lists of bugs open in various versions of each package. It
    considers a bug to be open when it has no fixed version, or
    when it has been found more recently than it has been fixed.

    If no version is given, then the list of fixed versions for
    the bug is cleared. This is identical to the behaviour of
    reopen.

    This command will only cause a bug to be marked as not done
    if no version is specified, or if the version being marked
    found is equal to the version which was last marked
    fixed. (If you are certain that you want the bug marked as
    not done, use reopen in conjunction with found.)

    This command was introduced in preference to reopen because
    it was difficult to add a version to that command's syntax
    without suffering ambiguity.

notfound bugnumber version

    Remove the record that #bugnumber was encountered in the
    given version of the package to which it is assigned.

    This differs from closing the bug at that version in that the
    bug is not listed as fixed in that version either; no
    information about that version will be known. It is intended
    for fixing mistakes in the record of when a bug was found.

fixed bugnumber version

    Indicate that bug #bugnumber was fixed in the given version
    of the package to which it is assigned.

    This does not cause the bug to be marked as closed, it merely
    adds another version in which the bug was fixed. Use the
    bugnumber-done address to close a bug and mark it fixed in a
    particular version.

notfixed bugnumber version

    Remove the record that bug #bugnumber has been fixed in the given version.

    This command is equivalent to found followed by notfound (the found removes the fixed at a particular version, and notfound removes the found.)

submitter bugnumber originator-address | !

    Changes the originator of #bugnumber to originator-address.

    If you wish to become the new originator of the report you can use the
    ! shorthand or specify your own email address.

    While the reopen command changes the originator of other bugs merged
    with the one being reopened, submitter does not affect merged bugs.

forwarded bugnumber address

    Notes that bugnumber has been forwarded to the upstream maintainer at
    address. This does not actually forward the report. This can be used to
    change an existing incorrect forwarded-to address, or to record a new
    one for a bug that wasn't previously noted as having been forwarded.

notforwarded bugnumber

    Forgets any idea that bugnumber has been forwarded to any upstream
    maintainer. If the bug was not recorded as having been forwarded then
    this will do nothing.

retitle bugnumber new-title

    Changes the title of a bug report to that specified (the default is the
    Subject mail header from the original report.

    Unlike most of the other bug-manipulation commands when used on one of
    a set of merged reports this will change the title of only the
    individual bug requested, and not all those with which it is merged.

severity bugnumber severity

    Set the severity level for bug report #bugnumber to severity. No
    notification is sent to the user who reported the bug.

    Severities are critical, grave, serious, important, normal, minor, and
    wishlist.

    For their meanings please consult the general developers' documentation
    for the bug system.

clone bugnumber [ new IDs ]

    The clone control command allows you to duplicate a bug report. It is
    useful in the case where a single report actually indicates that
    multiple distinct bugs have occured. \"New IDs\" are negative numbers,
    separated by spaces, which may be used in subsequent control commands
    to refer to the newly duplicated bugs. A new report is generated for
    each new ID.

    Example usage:

        clone 12345 -1 -2
        reassign -1 foo
        retitle -1 foo: foo sucks
        reassign -2 bar
        retitle -2 bar: bar sucks when used with foo
        severity -2 wishlist
        clone 123456 -2
        reassign -2 foo
        retitle -2 foo: foo sucks
        merge -1 -2


merge bugnumber bugnumber ...

    Merges two or more bug reports. When reports are merged, opening,
    closing, marking or unmarking as forwarded and reassigning any of the
    bugs to a new package will have an identical effect on all of the
    merged reports.

    Before bugs can be merged they must be in exactly the same state:
    either all open or all closed, with the same forwarded-to upstream
    author address or all not marked as forwarded, all assigned to the same
    package or package(s) (an exact string comparison is done on the
    package to which the bug is assigned), and all of the same severity. If
    they don't start out in the same state you should use reassign, reopen
    and so forth to make sure that they are before using merge.

    If any of the bugs listed in a merge command is already merged with
    another bug then all the reports merged with any of the ones listed
    will all be merged together. Merger is like equality: it is reflexive,
    transitive and symmetric.

    Merging reports causes a note to appear on each report's logs; on the
    WWW pages this is includes links to the other bugs.

    Merged reports are all expired simultaneously, and only when all of the
    reports each separately meet the criteria for expiry.

unmerge bugnumber

    Disconnects a bug report from any other reports with which it may have
    been merged. If the report listed is merged with several others then
    they are all left merged with each other; only their associations with
    the bug explicitly named are removed.

    If many bug reports are merged and you wish to split them into two
    separate groups of merged reports you must unmerge each report in one
    of the new groups separately and then merge them into the required new
    group.

    You can only unmerge one report with each unmerge command; if you want
    to disconnect more than one bug simply include several unmerge commands
    in your message.

tags bugnumber [ + | - | = ] tag

    Sets a particular tag for the bug report #bugnumber to tag. No
    notification is sent to the user who reported the bug. + means adding,
    - means subtracting, and = means ignoring the current tags and setting
    them afresh. The default action is adding.

    Available tags currently include patch, wontfix, moreinfo,
    unreproducible, help, pending, fixed, security, upstream, fixed-upstream,
    potato, woody, sarge, sarge-ignore, sid and experimental.

    For their meanings, consult the Control->Help->Tags menu.

block bugnumber by  bug ...

    Note that the fix for the first bug is blocked by the other
    listed bugs.

unblock bugnumber by bug ...

    Note that the fix for the first bug is no longer blocked by
    the other listed bugs.

close bugnumber

    Close bug report #bugnumber.

    A notification is sent to the user who reported the bug, but (in
    contrast to mailing bugnumber-done@bugs) the text of the mail which
    caused the bug to be closed is not included in that notification. The
    maintainer who closes a report needs to ensure, probably by sending a
    separate message, that the user who reported the bug knows why it is
    being closed. The use of this command is therefore deprecated.

package [ packagename ... ]

    Limits the following commands so that they will only apply to bugs
    filed against the listed packages. You can list one or more packages. If
    you don't list any packages, the following commands will apply to all
    bugs. You're encouraged to use this as a safety feature in case you
    accidentally use the wrong bug numbers.

    Example usage:

        package foo
        reassign 123456 bar

        package bar
        retitle 123456 bar: bar sucks
        severity 123456 normal

        package
        severity 234567 wishlist

owner bugnumber address | !

    Sets address to be the \"owner\" of #bugnumber. The owner of a bug
    claims responsibility for fixing it and will receive all mail
    regarding it. This is useful to share out work in cases where a
    package has a team of maintainers.

    If you wish to become the owner of the bug yourself, you can use
    the ! shorthand or specify your own email address.

noowner bugnumber

    Forgets any idea that the bug has an owner other than the usual
    maintainer. If the bug had no owner recorded then this will do
    nothing.

archive bugnumber

    Archives a bug that had been archived at some point in the
    past but is currently not archived if the bug fulfills the
    requirements for archival, ignoring time.

unarchive bugnumber

    Unarchives a bug that was previously archived. Unarchival
    should generally be coupled with reopen and found/fixed as
    appropriate. Bugs that have been unarchived can be archived
    using archive assuming the non-time based archival
    requirements are met.
