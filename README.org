* A simple, modular and well organized Emacs configuration.
  This is the Emacs configuration I use and tweak every day. This may probably be a good
  starting point for people trying to learn Emacs, specially if you do ELisp
  and Ruby development. There is also some simple stuff for Jekyll and blogging.

  The modularization is a good example of how to keep your init files clean and sane.

*** Requirements
    - Emacs24.3 or greater.

*** Installation
    To install, clone this repo to and run =./setup_dotfiles=. This will create symbolic links from the
    repository to the =~/.emacs.d/= directory.

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    git clone https://github.com/rranelli/emacs-dotfiles/ && ./emacs-dotfiles/setup_dotfiles
    #+END_SRC

*** Other very nice configurations
    I have started using Emacs with [[https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit][emacs-starter-kit]], but [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][Emacs Prelude]] and Purcell's
    [[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][emacs.d]] are also good choices. If you're a (+hopefully former+) vim user,
    you should take a look at [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][spacemacs]].
